Java is a general-purpose, high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. Compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.

Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.

Creation of this repo was inspired by courses of Mosh Hamedani:

- Data Structures & Algorithms: Part 1
